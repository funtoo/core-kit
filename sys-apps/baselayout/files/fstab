# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# The root filesystem should have a pass number of either 0 or 1.
# All other filesystems should have a pass number of 0 or greater than 1.
#
# See the manpage fstab(5) for more information.
#

# IMPORTANT: The block devices/labels and filesystem types will need to be
#            changed during installation to match those of your system.
#            If you are using UEFI, your boot filesystem must be VFAT.
