Security
========
lm_sensors is not vulnerable to any known exploit.

Known vulnerabilities
---------------------

lm_sensors: Insecure temporary file creation â€” GLSA 200508-19
Unaffected versions >= 2.9.1-r1

  References:
    * https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/200508-19
    pwmconfig in LM_sensors before 2.9.1 creates temporary files insecurely, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on the fancontrol temporary file.

Updates
=======
There are some updates in the source code that are adding only new sensors (definitions), that would maybe make sense to add as a new/bumped release.
