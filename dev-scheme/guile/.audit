The fork of this catpkg in Funtoo has a long history. An important bug to make sense of it seems to be FL-1430, where
Dantrell says "...guile is not intended to be slotted at all. You should only have one version installed". However,
Gentoo's guile is slotted, which appears due to them moving to SLOT 12 instead of previously-used SLOT 0. This means
that Portage is in essence 'faked out' into thinking that two guiles can be installed alongside one another when they
cannot.

However, this is basically an ancient problem as guile 1.x is very old. Gentoo uses SLOT=12 for all guiles, whereas
we have SLOT 0 for guile-1.8 for some reason. But we should be able to just keep this with 1.3-release and eventually
phase out this fork.
