FL-5335. add guile-2.2.3. Only unkeyworded due to incompatibility with guile-2.0. Keep track in https://bugs.gentoo.org/640116.


Keep the guile versions as they are. guile-2 is very fragile ebuild and need update when its urgently needed.
Also there is a shim ebuild (Funtoo change) that allows to downgrade from guile2 to guile1.
