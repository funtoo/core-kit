LXD - Container management
**************************

lxc-3.0.2.ebuild is based on Gentoo's lxc-3.3 ebuild. It includes the addition of lxcfs as an RDEPEND, because lxcfs is really a good thing
and it's annoying to have to manually install. Also, the DEPEND on lxc has been bumped to 3.0.2. In theory, lxd will work with 2+ of lxc,
but this seems like a horrible idea. Lxc and lxd 3.0.2 were released simultaneously, so were tested together.


Latest upstream releases:

All CVE: (https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=lxd)
---------------------------------------------------------------
- CVE-2017-6507 An issue was discovered in AppArmor before 2.12. Incorrect handling of unknown AppArmor profiles in AppArmor init scripts, 
		upstart jobs, and/or systemd unit files allows an attacker to possibly have increased attack surfaces of processes that were 
		intended to be confined by AppArmor. This is due to the common logic to handle 'restart' operations removing AppArmor profiles 
		that aren't found in the typical filesystem locations, such as /etc/apparmor.d/. Userspace projects that manage their own AppArmor 
		profiles in atypical directories, such as what's done by LXD and Docker, are affected by this flaw in the AppArmor init script logic.
- CVE-2016-1582 LXD before 2.0.2 does not properly set permissions when switching an unprivileged container into privileged mode, which allows local 
		users to access arbitrary world readable paths in the container directory via unspecified vectors.
- CVE-2016-1581 LXD before 2.0.2 uses world-readable permissions for /var/lib/lxd/zfs.img when setting up a loop based ZFS pool, which allows local 
		users to copy and read data from arbitrary containers via unspecified vectors.
- CVE-2015-8222 The lxd-unix.socket systemd unit file in the Ubuntu lxd package before 0.20-0ubuntu4.1 uses world-readable permissions 
		for /var/lib/lxd/unix.socket, which allows local users to gain privileges via unspecified vectors. 

TODO:
cleanup old releases and files.
