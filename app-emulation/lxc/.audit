All CVE: (https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=lxc)
---------------------------------------------------------------
- CVE-2017-5985 lxc-user-nic in Linux Containers (LXC) allows local users with a lxc-usernet allocation to create network interfaces on the host 
		and choose the name of those interfaces by leveraging lack of netns ownership check.
- CVE-2016-8649 lxc-attach in LXC before 1.0.9 and 2.x before 2.0.6 allows an attacker inside of an unprivileged container to use an inherited file descriptor, 
		of the host's /proc, to access the rest of the host's filesystem via the openat() family of syscalls.
- CVE-2016-10124 An issue was discovered in Linux Containers (LXC) before 2016-02-22. When executing a program via lxc-attach, the nonpriv session can escape 
		to the parent session by using the TIOCSTI ioctl to push characters into the terminal's input buffer, allowing an attacker to escape the container.
- CVE-2015-1335 lxc-start in lxc before 1.0.8 and 1.1.x before 1.1.4 allows local container administrators to escape AppArmor confinement via a symlink attack 
		on a (1) mount target or (2) bind mount source.
- CVE-2015-1334 attach.c in LXC 1.1.2 and earlier uses the proc filesystem in a container, which allows local container users to escape AppArmor or SELinux confinement 
		by mounting a proc filesystem with a crafted (1) AppArmor profile or (2) SELinux label.
- CVE-2015-1331 lxclock.c in LXC 1.1.2 and earlier allows local users to create arbitrary files via a symlink attack on /run/lock/lxc/*.
- CVE-2013-6456 The LXC driver (lxc/lxc_driver.c) in libvirt 1.0.1 through 1.2.1 allows local users to (1) delete arbitrary host devices via 
		the virDomainDeviceDettach API and a symlink attack on /dev in the container; (2) create arbitrary nodes (mknod) via the virDomainDeviceAttach API and a symlink attack on /dev in the container; and cause a denial of service (shutdown or reboot host OS) via the (3) virDomainShutdown or (4) virDomainReboot API and a symlink attack on /dev/initctl in the container, related to "paths under /proc/$PID/root" and the virInitctlSetRunLevel function.
- CVE-2013-6441 The lxc-sshd template (templates/lxc-sshd.in) in LXC before 1.0.0.beta2 uses read-write permissions when mounting /sbin/init, 
		which allows local users to gain privileges by modifying the init file.
- CVE-2013-6436 The lxcDomainGetMemoryParameters method in lxc/lxc_driver.c in libvirt 1.0.5 through 1.2.0 does not properly check the status of LXC guests 
		when reading memory tunables, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and libvirtd crash) via a guest in the shutdown status, as demonstrated by the "virsh memtune" command.
- CVE-2011-4080 The sysrq_sysctl_handler function in kernel/sysctl.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.39 does not require the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability to modify 
		the dmesg_restrict value, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions and read the kernel ring buffer by leveraging root privileges, 
		as demonstrated by a root user in a Linux Containers (aka LXC) environment.
