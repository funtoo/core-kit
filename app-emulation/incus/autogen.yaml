    # https://github.com/lxc/incus/issues/855
    # Upstream Incus has  a particular policy around semantic versioning its release
    # artifacts that does not work well with the github-1 generator
    # Semantic versioning policy for releases as defined by their primary maintainer:
    # "Only releases that may release patch updates get a version string that includes a patch version."
    #
    # Upstream Inncus provides full semantically versioned tarballs directly from this site:
    # https://linuxcontainers.org/downloads/incus/
    # The problem with this is, even though the tarball has a correct semantic version,
    # the source directory within still could use a MAJOR.MINOR version
    #
    # We use a simple post_src_unpack ebuild function to accommodate
    # this semantic version artifact discrepancy and properly build incus
