I think the only difference in this funtoo version is to remove the upstream requirement for a very new baselayout version that we

/etc/profile.env.

Original info from Oleg:

In funtoo, zsh using zprofile that is compatible with funtoo's baselayout /etc/profile. The gentoo difference for profile look for:
