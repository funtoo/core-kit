In order to give users and developers greater flexibilty in their systems Funtoo
has introduced a new set of profiles. The main idea behind the Funtoo 1.0
profiles is to do away with the current monolithic "one size fit's all"
approach. Instead of setting one massive profile and then overriding whatever
you don't want, the Funtoo 1.0 Profile uses a new multi profile approach which
allows way more flexibility and customization.

In order to acheive this flexibility it was necessary to change the way profiles
are set from the previous /etc/make.profile symlink to using the
/etc/portage/make.profile/parent file. If you were still using the old profiles
Portage has attempted to automatically switch your system to the new profiles.
Should this have failed you will need to manually switch. Please go to
http://www.funtoo.org/wiki/Funtoo_1.0_Profile for more infomation on the new
profiles and instructions on how to manually switch.
