===========================
1.2-prime branch
---------------------------

Core-kit contains the core ebuilds for Funtoo Linux. It is designed to be a part of the Funtoo Linux kits system.

The ``1.2-prime`` branch of core-kit is currently marked as *development branch*. Please use ``1.0-prime`` for
production systems, not this branch.

The ``-prime`` suffix indicates that the eventual goal is for this kit branch to reach production-quality and
enterprise-class stability. Once this is achieved, we will only incorporate bug fixes for specific issues, and security
backports. We will *not* be bumping versions of ebuilds unless absolutely necessary and we have very strong belief that
they will not negatively impact the functionality on anyone's system.

You can track the stability rating of this branch by using the ``ego kit list`` command, which will display the current
stability rating of this kit branch.

Security Workarounds
--------------------

- ``net-dns/avahi`` has a not-yet-fixed vulnerability -- CVE-2017-6519 -- affecting versions 0.7 (latest version) and
  earlier.  Since no fix is currently available from the author, it is highly recommended that UDP multicast DNS traffic
  destined for port 5353 is blocked by a firewall, or that avahi is configured to not listen on externally-connected
  interfaces. See https://github.com/lathiat/avahi/issues/145
